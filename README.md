# Terminal Watch Widget

Terminal Watch Widget Face for Apple Watch.

![Watch Face](Screenshots/Watch_Preview.png)

For devices running watchOS 10 or higher.

Due to the fact that the new version of watchOS no longer supports app persistence,   

here we use widgets to achieve a Watch Face similar to the Terminal effect

Thank for TermiWatch https://github.com/kuglee/TermiWatch/
